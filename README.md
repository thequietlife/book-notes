ðŸ“š Notes of interesting bits of books. Sometimes I will re-read a book to find the bit that stood out to me. So I am hoping these notes are something I can reach for rather than finding the book and rereading it. 

ðŸ§¹ Another aim is to make me go through the books I have and see which ones I want to keep.
