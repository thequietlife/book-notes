#### How did eliot higgins do research when he started? He uncovered nuggets by a combination of the following, reading/watching:
* reports from human rights groups
* YouTube footage - new genre of soldier selfie
* Facebook - statements
* tumblr - photos

#### Brega, Libya 12 August 2011
* YouTube 'rebel video' - a gunman walking around 'newly captured Brega'
* eliot posted this video and in the comments readers questioned if it is actually in Brega - 'Could've been filmed ANYWHERE'
* eliot went through the video frame by frame
* 'soldier's face filled most of the frame'
* 'background, single-story, white-walled concreted building and lampost'
* 'the soldier was striding through the two-lane streets
* **eliot started to sketch the roadways onto a piece of paper**
* he sketched a 'little road map' from the movements of the soldier
* 'the soldier went down a sharply curved road'
* 'turned left at the T-junction'
* 'turned left again'
* **eliot opened Google maps and entered 'brega'**
*  clicked on satellite imagery
*  used the map he had drawn to match the Google map
*  the advantage of using paper is that he was able to turn the hand-drawn map around
